## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Device Modes

The app operates in three modes:

1. **Setup Mode**: Initial configuration screen

   - Choose between hot wallet or cold wallet
   - Generate wallet (cold) or scan address (hot)

2. **Cold Wallet Mode** (Device B - Offline):

   - Home: Wallet address display, action buttons
   - Sign: Transaction signing with QR scanning
   - Settings: Recovery phrase and address QR

3. **Hot Wallet Mode** (Device A - Online):
   - Home: Balance display, wallet overview
   - Send: Transaction creation and broadcasting

### Data Flow

**Transaction Signing Flow:**

```
Hot Wallet (Device A)                 Cold Wallet (Device B)
─────────────────────                 ──────────────────────
1. Create transaction
2. Display as QR code    ─────────>   3. Scan QR code
                                      4. Review details
                                      5. Sign with private key
6. Scan signed TX QR     <─────────   7. Display signed TX QR
7. Broadcast to network
```

### Security Architecture

**Cold Wallet (Device B):**

- Private keys stored in expo-secure-store (iOS Keychain / Android Keystore)
- Never accesses network
- Signs transactions locally
- Recovery phrase backed up by user

**Hot Wallet (Device A):**

- Watch-only address (no private keys)
- Connects to Ethereum RPC
- Constructs unsigned transactions
- Broadcasts signed transactions

**Communication:**

- Exclusively via QR codes
- JSON-serialized transaction objects
- No network communication between devices

## 🎯 Key Features Implemented

### Wallet Management

- ✅ HD wallet generation with mnemonic
- ✅ Secure private key storage
- ✅ Address derivation and display
- ✅ Recovery phrase backup

### Transaction Handling

- ✅ Unsigned transaction construction
- ✅ Transaction signing with private key
- ✅ EIP-1559 transaction support
- ✅ Gas estimation
- ✅ Transaction broadcasting

### User Interface

- ✅ Setup wizard for both modes
- ✅ QR code generation for addresses and transactions
- ✅ QR code scanning with camera
- ✅ Balance display (Sepolia testnet)
- ✅ Transaction review screens
- ✅ Visual security indicators

### Network Integration

- ✅ Sepolia testnet support (default)
- ✅ Balance fetching via RPC
- ✅ Transaction broadcasting
- ✅ Gas price estimation
- ✅ Transaction receipt verification

## 🔐 Security Features

1. **Air-Gap Protection**:

   - Cold wallet designed to work offline
   - Visual offline indicators
   - Warnings against internet connectivity

2. **Private Key Security**:

   - Stored in platform secure storage
   - Never exposed in memory unnecessarily
   - Recovery phrase shown only on demand

3. **Transaction Verification**:

   - Full transaction details shown before signing
   - User confirmation required
   - Address validation

4. **QR Code Safety**:
   - Invalid QR rejection
   - JSON validation
   - Error handling for corrupted data

## 🧪 Testing Recommendations

### Setup Testing

1. Install on two devices
2. Set up Device B as cold wallet
3. Set up Device A as hot wallet
4. Verify address matches on both devices

### Transaction Testing (Sepolia)

1. Get testnet ETH from faucet
2. Create transaction on hot wallet
3. Sign on cold wallet
4. Verify broadcast succeeds
5. Check transaction on Sepolia Etherscan

### Security Testing

1. Verify cold wallet works in airplane mode
2. Test private key persistence across app restarts
3. Verify recovery phrase can restore wallet
4. Test invalid QR code handling

## 📊 Code Quality

- ✅ No linter errors
- ✅ TypeScript strict mode compatible
- ✅ Proper error handling
- ✅ Consistent styling
- ✅ Component reusability
- ✅ Context-based state management

## 🚀 Ready for Use

The app is fully functional and ready for testing on Sepolia testnet. To use:

1. Install on both devices
2. Follow setup guide in README
3. Test with Sepolia testnet ETH
4. Never use on mainnet without thorough testing

## ⚠️ Current Limitations

- Supports ETH transfers only (no ERC-20 tokens)
- Sepolia testnet only (can be changed in config)
- Single account per device
- No transaction history persistence
- Manual QR scanning (no batch processing)

## 🛣️ Future Enhancements

### High Priority

- ERC-20 token support
- Mainnet configuration option
- Transaction history
- Multiple accounts

### Medium Priority

- Custom gas settings
- Address book
- Smart contract interactions
- WalletConnect support

### Low Priority

- Multi-chain support (Bitcoin, Solana)
- Hardware wallet import
- Multi-signature wallets
- Advanced fee estimation

## 📝 Notes

- All code follows React Native and Expo best practices
- Uses modern React patterns (hooks, context)
- Responsive to both light and dark themes
- Accessible on iOS and Android
- Camera permissions handled gracefully
- Proper loading states and error messages

**Implementation Status**: ✅ Complete and Ready for Testing

**Next Steps**: Test thoroughly on Sepolia testnet before considering mainnet use
