# PWA Icons

The icon files `icon-192.png` and `icon-512.png` are placeholder icons generated for the PWA manifest.

## To Customize

Replace these files with your own branded icons:
- `icon-192.png` (192x192 pixels)
- `icon-512.png` (512x512 pixels)

Both should follow the neobrutalism design:
- Bright background color (#FEFCE8)
- Bold black borders (4px)
- High contrast colors
- Clean, geometric shapes

## Current Icons

The current icons feature:
- Soft yellow background
- Blue square with black border
- Wallet emoji (ðŸ’¼) in the center

These can be regenerated or replaced as needed for branding.
